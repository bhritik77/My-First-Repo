    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design is the process of planning and creating the visual layout and structure of a website. 
        It focuses on elements like color schemes, typography, images, and the overall user interface (UI) to ensure a visually appealing and 
        functional design. Web designers aim to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience while ensuring the website is responsive, 
        meaning it works well on both desktops and mobile devices. The goal of web design is to combine aesthetics with usability to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
