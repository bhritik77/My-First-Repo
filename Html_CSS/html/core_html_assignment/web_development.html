    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves two main aspects: front-end development,
    which deals with the design and functionality of the user interface using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development,
    which focuses on the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality using technologies such as PHP, Python, 
    and Node.js. Web development aims to create responsive, secure, and efficient websites that provide a seamless user experience.</p>
