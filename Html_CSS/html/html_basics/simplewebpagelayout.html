    <h1>Skills Vs Degree</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In my opinion skills should be preferred over degree now let's expand it</p> 
    <p>So basically talking about degree first, you can get degree easily by not doing such effort. Everyone can easily get degree just you have 
        to took admission in college <br> but on other hand talking about skills, skills are whole different thing you can take admission in course just like
        degree but after that to achieve a good hand on that skills you have do it on your own practicing much as you can thinking optimisely,
        it not like that if you just took admission so you gonna have that skill.
